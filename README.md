Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform project to show climate related emission data from https://climatetrace.org/data. Development just started so very much work in progress right now!
Have started with showing sector emission data per country but ton of other info available as well (ideas very welcome!).

Running on
* iOS (SwiftUI + shared Compose Multiplatform UI)
* Android
* Desktop
* Web (Wasm)
* Web (Kotlin/JS) - contributed by https://github.com/yogeshVU
* Kotlin Notebook

The iOS client as mentioned includes shared Compose Multiplatform UI code.  It also includes option to use either SwiftUI or Compose code for the Country List screen (in both cases selecting a country will navigate to shared Compose emissions details screen).
